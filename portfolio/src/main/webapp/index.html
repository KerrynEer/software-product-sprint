            <h3> About Me 🧍 </h3>
            <p>
                My name is Kerryn and am a Year 3 Computer Science Undergraduate 💻 in NUS! 
                In these 3 years, I have been building a strong foundation in computer science principles and 
                picking up skills along the way by participating in hackathons and working on mini projects 
                (like this portfolio page) in my free time 👩‍💻! 

                Amazed by the myriad of areas this major has to offer, I am exploring different areas and am currently specialising in 4 of them! 
                They are Artificial Intelligence, Security, Database and Software Engineering! 
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to my computing journey, I have a strong interest in Biology 🧬 and teaching. 
                To date, I have been actively involved in being teaching assistants 👩‍🏫 for NUS modules 
                (CS1010 Programming Methodology and CP1002 Independent Software Development) as well as a A levels Biology tutor. 
            </p>
            <p> In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing calligraphy 🖌️ (both english and chinese) and watching movies/dramas/variety shows 📺! </p>
            <p> This is a portfolio page built from Google Software Product Sprint Program! It uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java and Google App Engine!</p>
